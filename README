NAME
    Plack::Middleware::NoDeflate - Prevent content from being deflated

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        enable 'NoDeflate';

DESCRIPTION
    Plack::Middleware::NoDeflate is middleware which prevents content from
    being deflated before being served. It sets HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING to a
    blank value, which means that HTML and text will not be deflated by
    servers and applications which respect this environment variable.

MOTIVATION
    Plack::Middleware::Debug does not work with deflated content. In many
    cases, you'll be able to fix this by disabling any deflation in the
    development process, but that's not always the case. Further, if you're
    trying to mangle the response body with your own middleware, you'll find
    yourself with the same problem.

    One way to deal with this would be to re-inflate the deflated content
    yourself. Another, simpler way, is simply to prevent the content from
    being deflated in the first place, which is what this module does.
